# To-Do-app

The simple To Do Application for the school task.

In this application I'm using HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL. CSS bootstrap is used to make the applications layout responsive in the browser. The code can you get from here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/, simply copy paste the code to the html page.

PHP code for adding and deleting task I put in the index.php meanwhile for the editing task I put in a separate file, edit.php. When the user want to edit the task it leads to an empty page with a task which they want to edit. For the 'mark as done' button , I use Javascript code.

Database that I use is Adminer 4.7.8 MySQL

I work in Vagrant and Scotchbox environment for this project.
